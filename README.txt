To run the program simply run:

run.sh 

with a the folder of your choosing from test1, test2, cti

so for example if i want to run the network in cti I run:

run.sh cti

now if I want to run that network with all nodes consisting of -p tags (poison reverse),
I'd run:

run.sh -p cti

test1 and cti will have nodes A, B, C, D, E 
test2 will have nodes A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H

the bash script will take care of that for you! :D
